                    <p>I'm a student of aeronautical engineering at École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et d'Aérotechnique (ISAE-ENSMA), in an double degree program with Universidade Federal de Uberlândia (UFU) in Brazil.</p>
					
				    <h3>Career Plan</h3>
					<p>My final goal is to be a sucessfull entrepeneur and for that to happen I must have a lot of previous experience, so I intend to work in the industry for many years to develop my management and people skills, which I believe, is as vital to a company’s health as its mission. I also hope for a very challenging position from which I can grow my technical and personal skills.</p>
				    
					<h3>My expectations for the work enviroment</h3>
                    <p>When I was at EPTA we had a leader, Felipe Ribeiro, which was extremely motivating. The team had dealt with a lot of problems because the university wound't give us permission to start the project alledging that building model rockets could be dangerous. So the team was mainly based on doing research to show its seriousness. Until Felipe began the president of the team, even thought we still had to constantly deal with disapontments from the university we all were extremely motivated and were constantly pushing ourselfs forwardto the point in which we stablishid a partnership with a nearby army center to launch the rockets and do propulsion tests there, which later evolved to a permission to start the project from the university. I consider this experience as one of the most importants in my life, because it showed me the power of a leader and inspired me to the kind of professional I want to be. With that said, I wish to be in a company  with this kind of enviroment, and will take an active part to maintain it.</p>
                
				    <h3>Why I chose energetics</h3>
                    <p>Since the value of a company relies on the value it brings to society, considering the lack or abundance of such in the market. I believe that the energy industry is going to be really critical in the next decades, since it's a vital part of our world. Specially with the climate change and the unavoidable change of 71% of the global energy source which it implicates. So I intend to acquire a lot of know-how in the energetic industry, since I believe that this will be a high-demand field in which a highly qualified professional can make a real difference that impacts the whole world energetically and enviromentally.</p>
