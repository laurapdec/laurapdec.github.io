                    <p>I'm a student of aeronautical engineering at École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et d'Aérotechnique (ISAE-ENSMA), in an double degree program with Universidade Federal de Uberlândia (UFU) in Brazil.</p>
									
					<button class="accordion">My family</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>I grew up with an amazing example of entrepeneur by my side, making me breakfast everyday, and it's undeniable the influence my dad had and still has on me. I would never have dreamt big without him, I would never know what Stanford and MIT were, in a small town in Brazil where nobody in my family had ever graduated in an federal university, if not for the huge influence of my dad. He offered and paid for my summer program at MIT during high school, just because he knew I dreamt about going there. He made the end of the year vacation itenirarium pass through stanford when I was 14, because he heard how much I talked about there. He brought me to France, when he absolutely didn't need, because he knew I would feel safer and simply wanted to be there for me. </p>
					
						<p>On the other hand I had a mother who dedicated her whole life and gave up her career to take care of me, make me feel loved and understood. The one who helped me develop my communication and social skills, the one who taught me, since very young, how to not let people step on me but also, how to understand the other and have compassion. She is the reason I went to high school in the capital of the state, a much larger city, which gave me all sorts of experience and opened my mind in a way I never could had I stayed where I was. She shows me the importance of finding your inner strength and how fragile your mental health can be, if you don't care for it properly.</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">My Career Plan</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>My final goal is to be a sucessfull entrepeneur and for that to happen I must have a lot of previous experience, so I intend to work in the industry for many years to develop my management and people skills, which I believe, is as vital to a company’s health as its mission. I also hope for a very challenging position from which I can grow my technical and personal skills.</p>

					<button class="accordion">My expectations for the work enviroment</button>
					<div class="panel">
                    	<p>When I was at EPTA we had a leader, Felipe Ribeiro, which was extremely motivating. The team had dealt with a lot of problems because the university wound't give us permission to start the project alledging that building model rockets could be dangerous. So the team was mainly based on doing research to show its seriousness. When Felipe began the president of the team, even thought we still had to constantly deal with disapontments from the university, we all were extremely motivated and were constantly pushing ourselfs forward to the point in which we stablished a partnership with a nearby army center to launch the rockets and do propulsion tests there. That later evolved to the team finally getting the university permission to start the project. I consider this experience as one of the most importants in my life, because it showed me the power of a leader and inspired me to the kind of professional I want to be. With that said, I wish to be in a company  with this kind of enviroment, and will take an active part to maintain it.</p>

					<button class="accordion">Why I chose energetics</button>
					<div class="panel">
	                    <p>Our society has already escaleted fast in our energy demand and according to the Kardashev scale we aren't even a Type I civilization. I do believe humankind will have a vast future with clean energy we just began to star wondering.Since the value of a company relies on the value it brings to society, considering the lack or abundance of such in the market. I believe that the energy industry is going to be really critical in the next decades, since it's a vital part of our world. Specially with the climate change and the unavoidable change of 71% of the global energy source which it implicates. So I intend to acquire a lot of know-how in the energetic industry, since I believe that this will be a high-demand field in which a highly qualified professional can make a real difference that impacts the whole world energetically and enviromentally.</p>

					<button class="accordion">Why I chose aeroespace</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>Since I was a kid the space always left me speechless, and I wasn't a very quiet child. I remember one of my first science classes which I was looking forward for a couple years, and when it finally happened I realized nothing I ever could imagine would ever be better than that class. That class was astrophysics. I came home and started using the computer in my house to find out all I could about the stars, the kinds, how long the lasted, how far away they were, and I made the first academic presentation of my life. I had already played with powerpoint, so I was no strangeer to it, but I never used it to learn something until that point. I made a short video out of it and remember taking it to school in a DVD and giving it to my teacher, which was suprised and ended up playing it for the whole class.</p>
					</div>

					<button class="accordion">What do I wanna be when I grow up?</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>As a kid I was always being asked this question, but I don't think people should ever stop asking themselves this. I will grow until the moment I die, so what do I wanna be when I grow up? And what will I want then? Why would it have to be the same thing? Why did the greeks studied math, philosophy, sciences and art while we have to swear upon a job. I don't want a job, I want a career. I want a journey of obsacles and self improvement. I don't think this answer is supposed to be a testimony under oath either, I just think it makes me know myself more, so maybe it'll make you know me more.</p>
						<p>Throught my life this answer has changed at the same pace I did, but I always knew I was going to be on science, and one of the most remarcable for me is when I decided I would be an astronaut, about 8 years old. My sister, which was also young, told me that when astronauts come back, they have to stay on wheel chairs for the rest of their lifes. And that's how I spent years without thinking of being an astronaut, but it never took my eyes of the sky though.</p>

					<button class="accordion">Other interests</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<h4>Music</h4>
						<p>I have also always enjoyed to write, I wrote some tales, some poetry and a lot of music, but it was always just a hobby. I did think about trying to do something with this, but I think I wouldn't be happy, specially being subjected to such a corrosive industry. So one of my long range goals is to take a part in making this industry better, by creating a label, with the philosophy of a sevice provider, which would be turned to the interest of the artists and not on profit. But for this to happen, it could not be my career, because we are all suceptible to greed in some degree and I would hate to see myself become what I was trying to change. And this is a expensive industry very dominated by huge corporations, so to make a real change I would have to make a large investment. In conclusion I do intend to pursue this at some point, but I also do know that this point is far in the future, after my personal sucess.
