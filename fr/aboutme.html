                    <p>I'm a student of aeronautical engineering at École Nationale Supérieure de Mécanique et d'Aérotechnique (ISAE-ENSMA), in an double degree program with Universidade Federal de Uberlândia (UFU) in Brazil.</p>

					<button class="accordion">My family</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>I grew up with an amazing example of entrepeneur by my side, making me breakfast everyday, and it's undeniable the influence my dad had and still has on me. I would never have dreamt big without him, I would never know what Stanford and MIT were, in a small town in Brazil where nobody in my family had ever graduated in an federal university, if not for the huge influence of my dad. He offered and paid for my summer program at MIT during high school, just because he knew I dreamt about going there. He made the end of the year vacation itenirarium pass through stanford when I was 14, because he heard how much I talked about there. He brought me to France, when he absolutely didn't need, because he knew I would feel safer and simply wanted to be there for me. </p>
					
						<p>On the other hand I had a mother who dedicated her whole life and gave up her career to take care of me, make me feel loved and understood. The one who helped me develop my communication and social skills, the one who taught me, since very young, how to not let people step on me but also, how to understand the other and have compassion. She is the reason I went to high school in the capital of the state, a much larger city, which gave me all sorts of experience and opened my mind in a way I never could had I stayed where I was. She shows me the importance of finding your inner strength and how fragile your mental health can be, if you don't care for it properly.</p>
					</div>
					<button class="accordion">My Career Plan</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>My final goal is to be a sucessfull entrepeneur and for that to happen I must have a lot of previous experience, so I intend to work in the industry for many years to develop my management and people skills, which I believe, is as vital to a company’s health as its mission. I also hope for a very challenging position from which I can grow my technical and personal skills.</p>

					<button class="accordion">Expectation to work enviroment</button>
					<div class="panel">
                    	<p>I hope for a collaborative, challenging and motivating work enviroment. I do not mind of extense work hours and do not expect an easy, instead I wish to encounter hardship through which I can grow. Finally, besides the professional development, I expect to also improve my management and communication skills.</p>

					<button class="accordion">Rocketry team (EPTA)</button>
					<div class="panel">
	                    <p>In Brazil, I was in the rocketry team, which was a great experience on teamwork, resilience, and leadership. The team was new, so the university feared any accidents. Therefore they did not permit us to construct the rockets. To earn their trust, we conducted valuable research presented at international congresses. Even though we rarely got positive returns, we kept our spirits up and built a solid theoretical basis where future members could easily access the relevant information.</p>
						<p>During this period, I gave a one-week course in Python to raise funds, developed a few codes for future projects, conducted research on neural network prediction for aerodynamic coefficients and made a beginner's manual to rocketry aerodynamics. I also developed leadership skills when I got a promotion as chief of the aerodynamic sector. When I left the team, we had already had our first attempt to launch a rocket, with university permission in an army base nearby. As a result of our resilience, they just won second place in the Latin American Space Challenge (LASC) for the category of 1km apogee with solid propulsion.</p>

					<button class="accordion">Fluid mechanics laboratory</button>
					<div class="panel">
	                    <p>I also was a member of the fluid mechanics laboratory at my university in Brazil, where I researched both fluid mechanics and combustion in a project funded by Petrobras through a scholarship. I participated in an article on Physics of Fluids with my advisor in which I developed simple simulations with the new methodology and post-processed the data. Besides that, I made slight improvements in the in-house code Multi-Physics Simulator (MFSim), published articles and presented seminars on my research. This experience was valuable because I learned with hands-on experience collaborative coding, which implicated in developing my communication and organization skills.</p>

					<button class="accordion">My interest in energetics</button>
					<div class="panel">
	                    <p>Our society has already escaleted fast in our energy demand. I do believe humankind will have a vast future with clean energy we just began exploring. Since the value of a company relies on the value it brings to society, considering the lack or abundance of such in the market. I believe that the energy industry is going to be really critical in the next decades, since it's a vital part of our world that will suffer abrupt changes in order to protect our enviroment. So I intend to acquire a lot of know-how in the energetic industry, because I believe that this will be a high-demand field in which a highly qualified professional can make a real difference that impacts the whole world energetically and enviromentally.</p>

					<button class="accordion">My interest in aeroespace</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>Since I was a kid the space always left me speechless, from looking at the stars to finally understanding the depth and complexity of our universe. Combined with my large interest in STEM, aeronautical and aerospace engineering is a compeling opportunity to make a diference in this field I am very passionate about. In addition, it is one of the most interesting fields to study energetics, a field I am very interested in and allows me to make real improvements in our world.</p>

					<button class="accordion">What do I wanna be when I grow up?</button>
					<div class="panel">
						<p>As a kid I was always being asked this question, but I don't think people should ever stop asking themselves this. I will grow until the moment I die, so what do I wanna be when I grow up? And what will I want then? Why would it have to be the same thing? Why did the greeks studied math, philosophy, sciences and art while we have to swear upon a job. I don't want a job, I want a career. I want a journey of obsacles and self improvement. I don't think this answer is supposed to be a testimony under oath either, I just think it makes me know myself more, so maybe it'll make you know me more.</p>
						<p>Throught my life this answer has changed at the same pace I did, but I always knew I was going to be on STEM. When I was about 8 years old I decided I would be an astronaut, however my sister, which was also young, told me that when astronauts come back, they have to stay on wheel chairs for the rest of their lifes. Because of that I gave up on this dream until I discovered, years after, that it wasn't true. Nowadays I </p>

						<h4>Music</h4>
						<p>I have also always enjoyed to write, I wrote some tales, some poetry and a lot of music, but it was always just a hobby. I did think about trying to do something with this, but I think I wouldn't be happy, specially being subjected to such a corrosive industry. So one of my long range goals is to take a part in making this industry better, by creating a label, with the philosophy of a sevice provider, which would be turned to the interest of the artists and not on profit. But for this to happen, it could not be my career, because we are all suceptible to greed in some degree and I would hate to see myself become what I was trying to change. And this is a expensive industry very dominated by huge corporations, so to make a real change I would have to make a large investment. In conclusion I do intend to pursue this at some point, but I also do know that this point is far in the future, after my personal sucess.
